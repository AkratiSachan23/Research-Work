1. Hate Speech Detection Using LSTM-BERT Hybrid Model
Designed a deep learning framework that combines the temporal modeling strength of LSTM with the contextual richness of BERT embeddings to classify hate speech on Reddit. Achieved 96% accuracy and 0.94 F1-score, outperforming CNN, SVM, and standalone LSTM models. Highlights the model's robustness in handling complex and nuanced social media text.

2. Hate Speech Detection Using CNN and Gradient Boosting with FastText Feature Expansion
Proposed a hybrid architecture integrating CNN for feature extraction, FastText for subword-level embeddings, and Gradient Boosting for classification to detect hate speech in noisy, imbalanced Reddit data. The model achieved 85% F1-score and ROC-AUC of 0.92, outperforming traditional ML and transformer models in both precision and robustness.
